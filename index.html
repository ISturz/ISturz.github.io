                            <p>
                                Email Obfuscation System is an application made by a team of four including myself. 
                                This application was created for our final Capstone project. Over 17 weeks my team and I,
                                planned, designed, developed, tested and released this application. 
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The EOS application was created on Visual Studio using C#, HTML, CSS, while the database was created using MongoDB. My team and I followed an Agile-Scrum Methodology, we had four 4-week sprints and used Jira to track our progress.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                Email Obfuscation System is an application that allows a registed user to generate an EOS email address. 
                                These generated emails are linked to the users primary email address and allow the user to register for other sites/applications using the generated address.
                                Any emails recieved by the generated email address will be forward from our domain to the users primary address. From the users perspective, they still recieve the emails in their primary inbox.
                                However, if there was to be a data leak on that site or application that the user registed for, or they were reciving spam, the user can simply make their was into our application,
                                and diactivate the generated email address.

                                I have been tasked with redesigning the Shiny Side-Up website to enhance its aesthetic appeal and functionality. My main objective is to transform the website into a sleek, professional, and user-friendly platform that meets the client's needs and expectations.
                                To achieve this, I am utilizing WordPress, as per the client's preference, to create a responsive and visually appealing design.

                                The Lion Vs Cheetah application is a project created for my Intelligent Systems Course. 
                                <br>
                                The "Lion Vs Cheetah" project is an innovative deep learning initiative aimed at distinguishing between 
                                lions and cheetahs using machine learning models. This project leverages the power of artificial intelligence 
                                to analyze and classify images of these animals accurately.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                In collaboration with a colleague, we developed a robust deep learning model capable of differentiating between lions and cheetahs. The process involved several critical steps:
                    <br>MODEL DEVELOPMENT: We created and fine-tuned various machine learning models using Python in Jupyter Notebooks. This involved selecting appropriate architectures, preprocessing the data, and implementing effective training strategies to optimize model performance.
                    <br>TRAINING AND TESTING: The models were then trained and tested on a comprehensive dataset of lion and cheetah images. We employed techniques such as data augmentation and cross-validation to enhance the model's accuracy.
                    <br>MODEL TUNING: To achieve the best possible performance, we fine-tuned the hyperparameters and iteratively improved the models based on validation results. This step was crucial to maximizing prediction accuracy.
                    <br>FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT: To make the model accessible and user-friendly, we developed a simple front-end web application. This application allows users to upload a photo of either a cheetah or a lion. The model then processes the image and predicts whether it is a cheetah or a lion based on the learned patterns.

                                The "Tower Defense Game" is an engaging and strategic video game developed as part of a game development class. 
                                This project involves placing towers to defend against waves of enemies.
                                <br>
                                <br>
                                The objective of the game is to strategically place three different types of towers on designated platforms to defend 
                                against waves of enemies attempting to reach an endpoint. The player's mission is to eliminate all enemy characters 
                                before they can reach their goal.

                                GAME DEVELOPMENT: We utilized Unity, a powerful game development engine, to create the game. This involved programming all game mechanics, including tower placement, enemy movement, and wave progression.
                                <br>PROGRAMMING: We programmed all aspects of the game, from the behavior of the towers and enemies to the overall game logic. This included implementing different tower types with unique abilities and ensuring the game ran smoothly.
                                <br>RENDERING: We rendered all elements within the game, ensuring that both the visual and functional aspects met high standards. This included optimizing performance and making sure the game looked visually appealing.

                                In collaboration with a colleague, I developed a 2D Platform Runner game using Unity for a game development class. 
                                The primary objective of this game is to create an endless runner experience, where the player controls a character 
                                that must jump, run, and avoid obstacles in a constantly looping environment.
                                <br>

                                ENDLESS LOOP MECHANISM: We implemented a system where the game continuously loops through three different scenes. This required careful design to ensure a seamless transition between sections, maintaining the endless nature of the game.
                                <br>CHARACTER CONTROL: The game features mechanics for running, jumping, and other actions. We programmed the character's movement and interaction with the environment, ensuring smooth and responsive controls.
                                <br>ANIMATIONS: We incorporated animations to enhance the visual appeal and realism of the character's actions. This included animations for running, jumping, taking damage, and other states.
                                <br>HEALTH & DAMAGE SYSTEMS: To add depth to the gameplay, we included health and damage systems. The player must avoid obstacles and enemies to maintain their health, adding a layer of challenge to the game.
                                <br>COLLABORATIVE DEVELOPMENT: Throughout the project, we worked closely together, dividing tasks such as coding, level design, and testing to ensure a polished final product.
